# 1. An Alternative History: Slow Time

Class SlowTime obtains the total milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 (GMT)--the so-called UNIX epoch--and uses modulo division, integer division, and casting to derive what the local time would be had daylight savings time not been adopted.

In counties near states that observed Daylight Savings Time, you used to have to specify whether your event was scheduled on "fast time" or "slow time."

Indianapolis was not such a jurisdiction, but you did have to tell
out-of-state friends and relatives which time zone you were "the same as", Central or Eastern.
